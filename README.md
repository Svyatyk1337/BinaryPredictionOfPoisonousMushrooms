In this competition, I participated to solve the task of predicting poisonous mushrooms. I used several approaches, including neural networks, as well as traditional machine learning models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. I also experimented with handling categorical artifacts present in the dataset and evaluated their impact on model accuracy. Through these experiments, I gained insights into combining different machine learning methods for optimal performance.
